# Ï€(x)

A personalized memorization tool for the decimal digits of pi.

I memorize in terms of **bytes**, further broken down into **nibbles** and conjoined into **words**.

A word is a sequence of 32 digits. One of my favourite words is 82778577 13427577 89609173 63717872.

Within a nibble, patterns often arise like xyxz or xyzz. For instance, the above word has an identical xyzz pattern for two consecutive nibbles. The fourth nibble is xyxx which is even better, and synergizes with the preceding ubiquity of 7.

Sometimes, nibbles aren't so nice. I'll expand or contract a nibble into 3-6 digits instead because there's a more obvious pattern. One example of this is 09 171 536 436 789 2590.
